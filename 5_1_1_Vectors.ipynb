        "\n",
        "The dot product of two vectors is a scalar value that represents the extent to which the two vectors are aligned with each other. Geometrically, the dot product can be interpreted in the following ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Angle between two vectors: The dot product of two vectors is equal to the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. This means that if the dot product of two vectors is positive, then the angle between them is acute (less than 90 degrees), if it is negative, then the angle between them is obtuse (greater than 90 degrees), and if it is zero, then the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Projection of a vector onto another vector: The dot product can also be interpreted as the projection of one vector onto another vector. The projection of a vector onto another vector is the length of the vector that lies along the direction of the other vector. If the two vectors are normalized, then the dot product is equal to the cosine of the angle between them, and the projection is simply the magnitude of one vector multiplied by the dot product.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Work done by a force: The dot product can also be interpreted as the work done by a force. If a force F acts on an object and displaces it by a distance d, then the work done by the force is given by the dot product of the force and the displacement, i.e., W = F · d. The work done by the force is positive if the force and displacement are in the same direction, and negative if they are in opposite directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are some of the common geometric interpretations of the dot product of two vectors.\n",

        "**1.2 Given a vector u, find vector  v of unit length such that the dot product of  u and  v is maximum.**\n",
        "\n",
        "To find the vector v of unit length such that the dot product of u and v is maximum, you need to find a unit vector in the direction of u. The dot product of two vectors is given by the formula:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Where ||u|| and ||v|| represent the magnitudes of vectors u and v, respectively, and θ is the angle between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dot product is maximized when the angle between the two vectors is 0 (cos(0) = 1), which means that vector v should have the same direction as vector u. To obtain a unit vector in the direction of u, you should normalize u.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let u = (x1, x2, ..., xn). To normalize u, divide each component of u by its magnitude:\n",
        "\n",

If we have three vectors in three-dimensional space, they are linearly independent if they do not lie in the same plane. In general, n vectors in n-dimensional space are linearly independent if they do not lie in any subspace of dimension less than n.\n",
